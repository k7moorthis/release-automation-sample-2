  This issue has been automatically marked as `stale` because it has not had
  recent activity 💤. Because the Electron App team treats their issues
  [as their backlog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)#Product_backlog),
  stale issues will be closed after a week from the day of marking. If you
  would like this issue to remain open:
   
   1. Verify that you can still reproduce the issue in the latest version of Electron App
   2. Update the issue template with the following details:
      * What version of Electron App you reproduced the issue on
      * What OS and version you reproduced the issue on
      * What steps you followed to reproduce the issue
   3. Comment that the issue is still reproducible
